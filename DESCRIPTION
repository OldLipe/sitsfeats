Description: Provides a set of temporal metrics derived from satellite image time series.
    The basics metrics are composed of basic statistics, histogram-based statistics, and methods 
    based on time series analysis.
    The polar metrics, an approach proposed by Korting et al. (2013) <doi:10.1016/j.cageo.2013.02.007>, 
    is based on the polar representation to describe cyclic events, whose events are common in agricultural applications.
