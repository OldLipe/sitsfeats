<!-- TODO: improve this text -->

The goal of the sitsfeats package is to extract temporal metrics from satellite images time series. The metrics implemented in this version are:
  
  - **basics**: statistics metrics
  - **polar**: polar metrics

## Installation

You can install the development version of sitsfeats from [github](https://github.com/OldLipe/sitsfeats) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("oldlipe/sitsfeats")
```

## How to use?

### Polar metrics example
```{r}
# loading sitsfeats and tibble packages
library(sitsfeats)
library(tibble)

# loading example time series
data("timeseries")

polar_metrics <- tibble::tibble(area_q1 = sitsfeats::area_q1(timeseries),
                                area_q2 = sitsfeats::area_q2(timeseries),
                                area_q3 = sitsfeats::area_q3(timeseries),
                                area_q4 = sitsfeats::area_q3(timeseries))

polar_metrics
```

### Polar metrics visualization

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.height=5, fig.width=9, dpi=300}
# plot first time series example
sitsfeats::polar_plot(timeseries[1,])
```
